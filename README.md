# JewelVerse - A React-based Jewelry Marketplace with Spring Boot Backend

This project consists of a front-end application built with React and a back-end API built with Spring Boot, designed for a jewelry marketplace. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and purchasing jewelry items. This README focuses on the Spring Boot backend component. A separate README exists for the React frontend.

## Introduction

JewelVerse aims to create a seamless online experience for buying and selling jewelry. This project comprises a React front-end (documented separately) for user interaction and a Spring Boot back-end for data management, user authentication, and order processing. This README details the Spring Boot backend component.

## Features (Backend)

* **Product Management:** API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting jewelry products.
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration, login, and authorization.
* **Order Processing:** API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing orders.
* **Inventory Management:** Tracking and updating jewelry inventory.
* **Data Persistence:** Storing and retrieving data from a database.
* **API Documentation:** (Ideally, include a link to Swagger or a similar API documentation tool if used)

## Technologies Used (Backend)

* Spring Boot
* Java
* Spring Data JPA (for database interaction)
* Spring Security (for authentication and authorization)
* [Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)]
* [Other Libraries/Frameworks (e.g., Lombok, MapStruct)]

## Installation (Backend)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/musketeers-backend.git # Replace with your actual repository URL
   cd musketeers-backend
   ```

2. **Ensure you have Java JDK (version 17 or later, e.g., JDK 21, compatible with Maven release 17) and Maven installed.**
   * Verify your active Java version for Maven using `mvn -v`.
   * Ensure `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your JDK 17+ installation.

3. **Set up MySQL:**
   * Install MySQL server.
   * Create a database (e.g., `jewelrystore`).
   * Create a MySQL user with privileges for this database.
   * Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL URL, username, and password.

4. **Build the project:**
   Open a terminal in the `musketeers-backend` directory and run:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   This command will also download dependencies and compile the code.

## Usage (Backend)

1. **Run the application:**
   After a successful build, you can run the application using:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The backend will typically start on `http://localhost:8081/api` (as configured in `application.properties`).

## Project Structure (Backend)

* **src/main/java:** Contains the Java source code for the application.
* **src/main/resources:** Contains configuration files such as `application.properties`.
* **pom.xml:** Maven configuration file for managing dependencies and build settings.

## API Endpoints

* **Products:** `/api/products`
* **Users:** `/api/users`
* **Orders:** `/api/orders`
