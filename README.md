* **Order Processing:**  API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing orders.
* **Inventory Management:**  Tracking and updating jewelry inventory.
* **Data Persistence:**  Storing and retrieving data from a database.
* **API Documentation:**  (Ideally, include a link to Swagger or a similar API documentation tool if used)

## Technologies Used (Backend)

* Spring Boot
* Java
* Spring Data JPA (for database interaction)
* Spring Security (for authentication and authorization)
* [Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)]
* [Other Libraries/Frameworks (e.g., Lombok, MapStruct)]
